# Welcome to d4rk-k3rm1t Security Solutions 🐸

Hi, I’m **k3rm1t** — founder of **d4rk-k3rm1t Security Solutions**, a veteran-owned cybersecurity outfit focused on offensive security, red teaming, and creative problem-solving at the edge of the digital frontier.

This site serves as a centralized repository for my personal research, tooling, notes, and blog posts tailored for Red Team Operators, Penetration Testers, and security engineers. Whether you're sharpening your skills, hunting for novel TTPs, or gearing up for certifications like OSED or CRTO, this space is designed to support your growth and keep you ahead of the curve.

## What You'll Find Here

Expect regular updates packed with hands-on resources, including:

- 🔍 Vulnerability Research & Exploitation Techniques  
- 🛠️ Custom Tools, Scripts, and Payload Writeups  
- 🧠 Post-Exploitation Methods & Tradecraft  
- 📚 Notes from Engagements, Labs, and Real-World Scenarios  

I’m building this as both a lab journal and a public knowledge base — with the hope it equips others in the field to think deeper, move stealthier, and build better.
